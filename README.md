# Card_Game-BigTwo-

I have implemented the Big Two card game in form of a java project. This project uses inheritance, polymorphism, GUI, event-handling networking and multi-threading, and their implementations using OOPs concepts in Java. You may refer to their Javadoc for details of these classes and interfaces.
